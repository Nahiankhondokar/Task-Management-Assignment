## Project Description 
This project is for task management. We can create new tasks with proper validation, date & work status. we can view, edit, update, and delete each task. We can filter by task status & sort by taks end date. we have also login, registration & logout feature. I have also added APIs for implementation in other front-end applications through these APIs. API authentication is managed by Laravel Sanctum. we can add so many new features here as our client demands. this is just a simple Task Management System.
